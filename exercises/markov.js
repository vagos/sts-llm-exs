/*
Some guidance:

1. Create a corpus. This will a global variable to which you will assign the contents of the file shakespeare.txt (inside the data directory). You can use the fs module to read the file.
3. Create the markov model. This can be an object with a property for each word in the corpus. The value of each property will be an array of words that follow the key word in the corpus.
3. Create a function that generates random text using the markov model. The function should take a length argument that specifies the number of words to generate.

Try to generate text that is at least 100 words long. You can use the console to log the output of your function, or you can write the output to a file.
