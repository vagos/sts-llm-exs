/*
    Some guidance:

1. Start by explanding from the incorrect-shell-code.js example and simply change the system prompt to generate a shell script.
2. Then, you can ask the LLM to add small errors to the shell script.
3. You can ask the LLM to add comments to the shell script.
4. Finally, take input from the user on how many lines the shell script should be.
   Make sure to verify the the text produced by the LLM is indeed that many lines.
