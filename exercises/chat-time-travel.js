/* 
    Some guidance:

1. Start by creating a simple app that allows the user to send messages to the LLM.
2. After each message, append the message to a file. You can use fs.appendFile for this.
3. To create a git repository, you can use the simple-git package, or just call `git init` using the child_process module.
4. To commit the file, you can use simple-git or call `git commit` using the child_process module.
5. You can then ask the user if they want to continue the conversation or branch off.
6. If they branch off, you can use simple-git to create a new branch.
7. The user can then traverse the conversation using `git checkout`.
